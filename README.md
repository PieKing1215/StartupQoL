# Startup QoL
### Minecraft Forge mod that adds a couple of quality-of-life features to startup. 

Prevents the game from going fullscreen until after it's completely done loading.<br>
Also displays the total startup time on the main menu.

This mod is client-side, so it does not need to be installed on the server for it to work.
